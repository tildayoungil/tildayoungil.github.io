## Buttons

Make any link standout more when applying the `.btn` class.

## Notices

Basic notices or call-outs are supported using the following syntax:

```markdown
**Watch out!** You can also add notices by appending `{: .notice}` to the line following paragraph.
{: .notice}
```

which wil render as:

**Watch out!** You can also add notices by appending `{: .notice}` to the line following paragraph.
{: .notice}

### Footnotes

Footnotes can be useful for clarifying points in the text, or citing information.[^1] Markdown support numeric footnotes, as well as text as long as the values are unique.[^note]

```markdown
This is the regular text.[^1] This is more regular text.[^note]

[^1]: This is the footnote itself.
[^note]: This is another footnote.
```

[^1]: Such as this footnote.
[^note]: When using text for footnotes markers, no spaces are permitted in the name.

## HTML Tags

### Address Tag

<address>
  1 Infinite Loop<br /> Cupertino, CA 95014<br /> United States
</address>

### Anchor Tag (aka. Link)

This is an example of a [link](http://github.com "GitHub").

### Abbreviation Tag

The abbreviation CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets".

*[CSS]: Cascading Style Sheets

### Cite Tag

"Code is poetry." ---<cite>Automattic</cite>

### Code Tag

You will learn later on in these tests that `word-wrap: break-word;` will be your best friend.

You can also write larger blocks of code with syntax highlighting supported for some languages, such as Python:

```python
print('Hello World!')
```

or R:

```R
print("Hello World!", quote = FALSE)
```

### Details Tag (collapsible sections)

The HTML `<details>` tag works well with Markdown and allows you to include collapsible sections, see [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_details.asp) for more information on how to use the tag.

<details>
  <summary>Collapsed by default</summary>
  This section was collapsed by default!
</details>

The source code:

```HTML
<details>
  <summary>Collapsed by default</summary>
  This section was collapsed by default!
</details>
```

Or, you can leave a section open by default by including the `open` attribute in the tag:

<details open>
  <summary>Open by default</summary>
  This section is open by default thanks to open in the &lt;details open&gt; tag!
</details>


### Emphasize Tag

The emphasize tag should _italicize_ text.

### Insert Tag

This tag should denote <ins>inserted</ins> text.

### Keyboard Tag

This scarcely known tag emulates <kbd>keyboard text</kbd>, which is usually styled like the `<code>` tag.

### Preformatted Tag

This tag styles large blocks of code.

<pre>
.post-title {
  margin: 0 0 5px;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 38px;
  line-height: 1.2;
  and here's a line of some really, really, really, really long text, just to see how the PRE tag handles it and to find out how it overflows;
}
</pre>

### Quote Tag

<q>Developers, developers, developers&#8230;</q> &#8211;Steve Ballmer

### Strike Tag

This tag will let you <strike>strikeout text</strike>.

### Strong Tag

### Subscript Tag

Getting our science styling on with H<sub>2</sub>O, which should push the "2" down.

### Variable Tag

This allows you to denote <var>variables</var>.
